# Movie Reservation Project

Hello there!  This is a movie reservation project, where people can book tickets to go see a movie at a specific time and at specific seats.  The schema is not 100% complete yet, as functionality will be added to set prices for specific times, such as matinees, and to allow different prices for different age groups, e.g. childen vs. adults vs. seniors, and different prices for different seat types, like premium vs. regular seats.
