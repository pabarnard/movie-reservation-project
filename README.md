# Movie Reservation Project

Hello there!  This is a movie reservation project, where people can book tickets to go see a movie at a specific time and at specific seats.  The schema is now mostly set, as functionality will be added to set prices for specific times, such as matinees, and to allow different prices for different age groups, e.g. children vs. adults vs. seniors.  In the future, there might be functionality added to allow for different prices by seating types, like premium seats.
